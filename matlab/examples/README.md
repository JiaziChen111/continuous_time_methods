## Examples
* For variational methods to solve problems with option values, see [optimal_stopping/](optimal_stopping) 
* For the HJBE methods to solve the neoclassical growth model, see [neoclassical_growth/](neoclassical_growth) 
* Most of the examples for discretization of finite difference operators, etc. are in the tests folder instead.
